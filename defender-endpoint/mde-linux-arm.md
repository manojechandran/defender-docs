# Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux for ARM64-based devices (preview)

## Overview of Defender for Endpoint on Linux for ARM64-based devices

As you might already know, [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](microsoft-defender-endpoint-linux.md) is a unified endpoint security solution that helps you protect your server devices from advanced threats. Defender for Endpoint on Linux is now extending support for ARM64-based Linux servers in preview. Similar to x64-based Linux servers (including Intel and AMD 64-bit platform), the following capabilities are included: 

- Microsoft Defender Antivirus
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- Live response
- Device isolation
- Advanced hunting
- Vulnerability management
- Centralized policy configuration using security settings management

Initially, the following Linux distributions are supported in preview:

- Ubuntu 20.04 ARM64
- Ubuntu 22.04 ARM64
- Amazon Linux 2 ARM64
- Amazon Linux 2023 ARM64

> [!NOTE]
> Support for more Linux distributions is planned as part of this preview program.

The installation procedures in this article install the agent version `101.24102.0002` from the insiders-slow channel on the ARM64-based device. (See [What's new in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux](linux-whatsnew.md).) 

## Deploy Defender for Endpoint on Linux for ARM64-based devices

You can choose from several methods to deploy Defender for Endpoint on Linux to your ARM64-based device:

- [Installer script](#deploy-using-the-installer-script)

   ```

6. Validate your deployment by following these steps:

   1. On the device, run the following commands to check for device health, connectivity, antivirus, and EDR detections:

      ```YAML

      - name: Run post-installation basic MDE test
        hosts: myhosts
        tasks:
    
         - name: Check health
           ansible.builtin.command: mdatp health --field healthy
           register: health_status

         - name: MDE health test failed
           fail: msg="MDE is not healthy. health status => \n{{ health_status.stdout       }}\nMDE deployment not complete"
           when: health_status.stdout != "true"

         - name: Run connectivity test
           ansible.builtin.command: mdatp connectivity test

         - name: Connectivity failed
           fail: msg="Connectivity failed. Connectivity result => \n{{ connectivity_status.stdout }}\n MDE deployment not complete"
           when: connectivity_status.rc != 0

         - name: Check RTP status
           ansible.builtin.command: mdatp health --field real_time_protection_enabled
           register: rtp_status

         - name: Enable RTP
           ansible.builtin.command: mdatp config real-time-protection --value enabled
           become: yes
           become_user: root
           when: rtp_status.stdout != "true"

         - name: Pause for 5 second to enable RTP
           ansible.builtin.pause:
           seconds: 5

         - name: Download EICAR
           ansible.builtin.get_url:
           url: https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt
           dest: /tmp/eicar.com.txt

         - name: Pause for 5 second to detect eicar 
           ansible.builtin.pause:
           seconds: 5

         - name: Check for EICAR file
           stat: path=/tmp/eicar.com.txt
           register: eicar_test

         - name: EICAR test failed
           fail: msg="EICAR file not deleted. MDE deployment not complete"
           when: eicar_test.stat.exists

         - name: MDE Deployed
           debug:
           msg: "MDE succesfully deployed"

      ```

   2. In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), under **Assets** > **Devices**, look for the Linux device you just onboarded. It can take approximately 20 minutes for the device to show up in the portal.

7. If you run into an issue, see [Troubleshoot deployment issues](#troubleshoot-deployment-issues) (in this article).

### Deploy using the installer script with Puppet

1. In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), go to **Settings** > **Endpoints** > **Device management** > **Onboarding**.

2. In the onboarding screen, select the following options:

   :::image type="content" source="media/mde-linux-arm-puppet.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the onboarding screen in MDE for Puppet.":::

   1. In the **Select operating system to start onboarding process** list, select **Linux Server**.

   2. In the **Connectivity type** list, select **Streamlined**. Or, if necessary, you can select **Standard**. (For more information, see [Onboarding devices using streamlined connectivity for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](configure-device-connectivity.md).)

   3. In the **Deployment method** list, select **Your preferred Linux configuration management tool**.

   4. Select **Download onboarding package**. Save the file as `WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip`.

3. Extract the contents of the onboarding package by using the following command:

   `unzip WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip`

   You should see the following output:

   ```
   Archive:  WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
   inflating: mdatp_onboard.json
   ```

4. In a new browser window, download the [Defender for Endpoint installer bash script](https://github.com/microsoft/mdatp-xplat/blob/master/linux/installation/mde_installer.sh) (this script is called `mde_installer.sh`).

5. Create a Puppet manifest by using the following procedure, which uses the `mde_installer.sh` script from step 4.

   1. In the **modules** folder of your Puppet installation, create the following folders:

      - `install_mdatp/files` 
      - `install_mdatp/manifests`
      
      The **modules** folder is typically located at `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules` on your Puppet server.

   2. Copy the `mdatp_onboard.json` file created earlier to the `install_mdatp/files` folder.

   3. Copy `mde_installer.sh` to `install_mdatp/files folder`.

   4. Create an `init.pp` file inside `install_mdatp/manifests` that contains the following deployment instructions:

      ```bash
      tree install_mdatp
      Output: 
      install_mdatp
      ├── files
      │   ├── mdatp_onboard.sh
      │   └── mde_installer.sh
      └── manifests
          └── init.pp
      ```

6. Use the Puppet manifest to install Defender for Endpoint on Linux on your device.

   ```bash
   
   # Puppet manifest to install Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux.
   # @param channel The release channel based on your environment, insider-fast or prod.

   class install_mdatp (
     $channel = 'insiders-slow',
   ) {
     # Ensure that the directory /tmp/mde_install exists
     file { '/tmp/mde_install':
       ensure => directory,
       mode   => '0755',
     }

   # Copy the installation script to the destination
   file { '/tmp/mde_install/mde_installer.sh':
     ensure => file,
     source => 'puppet:///modules/install_mdatp/mde_installer.sh',
     mode   => '0777',
     }

   # Copy the onboarding script to the destination
   file { '/tmp/mde_install/mdatp_onboard.json':
    ensure => file,
    source => 'puppet:///modules/install_mdatp/mdatp_onboard.json',
    mode   => '0777',
    }

   #Install MDE on the host using an external script
   exec { 'install_mde':
    command     => "/tmp/mde_install/mde_installer.sh --install --channel ${channel} --onboard /tmp/mde_install/mdatp_onboard.json",
    path        => '/bin:/usr/bin',
    user        => 'root',
    logoutput   => true,
    require     => File['/tmp/mde_install/mde_installer.sh', '/tmp/mde_install/mdatp_onboard.json'], # Ensure the script is copied before running the installer
   }
   }
   ```

7. Validate your deployment. In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), under **Assets** > **Devices**, look for the Linux device you just onboarded. It can take approximately 20 minutes for the device to show up in the portal.

### Deploy Defender for Endpoint on Linux using Microsoft Defender for Cloud

If your organization is using Defender for Cloud, you can use it to deploy Defender for Endpoint on Linux.

1. We recommend enabling automatic deployment on your ARM64-based Linux devices. After VM provisioning, define a variable under the file `/etc/mde.arm.d/mde.conf` on your device as follows:

   `OPT_FOR_MDE_ARM_PREVIEW=1`

2. Wait for 1-6 hours for onboarding to complete.

3. In the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com), under **Assets** > **Devices**, look for the Linux devices you just onboarded.
