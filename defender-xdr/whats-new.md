In both the Microsoft Defender unified experience and in [Defender XDR advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-link-to-incident.md), you can now specify whether an entity is an impacted asset or related evidence.
- (Preview) In [advanced hunting](advanced-hunting-defender-use-custom-rules.md#use-adx-operator-for-azure-data-explorer-queries-preview), Microsoft Defender portal users can now use the `adx()` operator to query tables stored in Azure Data Explorer. You no longer need to go to log analytics in Microsoft Sentinel to use this operator if you are already in Microsoft Defender.
-  New documentation library for Microsoft's unified security operations platform. Find centralized documentation about [Microsoft's unified SecOps platform in the Microsoft Defender portal](/unified-secops-platform/overview-unified-security). Microsoft's unified SecOps platform brings together the full capabilities of Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Security Exposure Management, and generative AI into the Defender portal. Learn about the features and functionality available with Microsoft's unified SecOps platform, then start to plan your deployment.

## November 2024

- We've updated the steps to create tenant groups in multitenant management. Learn the new steps in the [content distribution using tenant groups in multitenant management](mto-tenantgroups.md).
- (Preview) **Attack paths** in the incident graph are now available in the Microsoft Defender portal. The attack story now includes potential attack paths that show the paths that attackers can potentially take after compromising a device. This feature helps you prioritize your response efforts. For more information, see [attack paths in the attack story](investigate-incidents.md#attack-paths).
- (Preview) Microsoft Defender XDR customers can now export incident data to PDF. Use the exported data to easily capture and share incident data to other stakeholders. For details, see **[Export incident data to PDF](manage-incidents.md#export-incident-data-to-pdf)**.
- (GA) The **last update time** column in the [incident queue](incident-queue.md#incident-queue) is now generally available.

You can use it to discover threats that can be observed through process details, like malicious processes or command-line signatures.
- (Preview) Migrating custom detection queries to **Continuous (near real-time or NRT) frequency** is now available for preview in advanced hunting. Using the Continuous (NRT) frequency increases your organization's ability to identify threats faster. It has minimal to no impact to your resource usage, and should thus be considered for any qualified custom detection rule in your organization. You can migrate compatible KQL queries by following the steps in [Continuous (NRT) frequency](custom-detection-rules.md#continuous-nrt-frequency).

## October 2024

This allows security operators to manage false positives more efficiently and without losing context. 



## June 2024

- (Preview) **[Content distribution through tenant groups in multitenant management](mto-tenantgroups.md)** is now available. Content distribution helps you manage content at scale across tenants in multitenant management in Microsoft Defender XDR.
