# What's new in Microsoft's unified security operations platform

This article lists recent features added into Microsoft's unified SecOps platform within the Microsoft Defender portal, and new features in related services that provide an enhanced user experience in the platform.

## December 2024

- [Microsoft Sentinel workbooks now available to view directly in the Microsoft Defender portal](#microsoft-sentinel-workbooks-now-available-to-view-directly-in-the-microsoft-defender-portal)

### Microsoft Sentinel workbooks now available to view directly in the Microsoft Defender portal

Microsoft Sentinel workbooks are now available for viewing directly in the Microsoft Defender portal with Microsoft's unified security operations (SecOps) platform. Now, in the Defender portal, when you select **Microsoft Sentinel > Threat management> Workbooks**, you remain in the Defender portal instead of a new tab being opened for workbooks in the Azure portal. Continue tabbing out to the Azure portal only when you need to edit your workbooks.

Microsoft Sentinel workbooks are based on Azure Monitor workbooks, and help you visualize and monitor the data ingested to Microsoft Sentinel. Workbooks add tables and charts with analytics for your logs and queries to the tools already available.

For more information, see [Visualize and monitor your data by using workbooks in Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/monitor-your-data) and [Connect Microsoft Sentinel to Microsoft Defender XDR](/defender-xdr/microsoft-sentinel-onboard).

### Microsoft Sentinel availability in Microsoft Defender portal

We previously announced Microsoft Sentinel is generally available within Microsoft's unified security operations platform in the Microsoft Defender portal. For preview, Microsoft Sentinel is now available in the Defender portal without Microsoft Defender XDR or an E5 license. For more information, see:

### Feature availability for Government clouds

In the Defender portal, all Microsoft Sentinel features for unified SecOps that are in general availability are now available in both commercial and GCC High and DoD clouds. Features still in preview are available only in the commercial cloud.
